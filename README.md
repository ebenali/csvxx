# CSV reader utility class (C++17)
Put together rather quickly for an improvised CSV ingestion script.
 - Has 'put-back' built-in.
 - Returns a [row, ok] pair a-la-golang.
 - Minimal CMakeLists.txt (header-only libcsvxx)

This repo may as well have been a gist.

Who knows it might turn into a proper project one of these days.
